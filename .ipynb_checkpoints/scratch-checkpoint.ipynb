It is simply betting on a team to win the game outright. Your team could win by 1 point or 50 points, it could require overtime or be done in regulation - all that you are betting on is the direct outcome of the game. The team with a - sign next to its odds is said to be the favorite and the team with the + sign next to its odds is the underdog. Speaking of odds, while the concept is simple the strategy of betting moneylines gets a little more complex. The odds directly determine how much you need to stake to win a certain amount of money. If the Golden State Warriors are -275 favorites over the Los Angeles Lakers, you would have to bet $275 to win only $100. Conversely, the Lakers are +200 underdogs a $100 bet would net you a $200 profit if they were to win.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"What is an NBA Point Spread?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"When you bet on an NBA point spread, you’re betting on the margin of victory (or defeat) as opposed to the outright winner of the game. Let’s say you bet the Golden State Warriors -6.5 vs the Los Angeles Lakers. This would mean that to win your bet the Warriors would need to win by at least 7 points. Conversely, if you bet the Lakers +6.5 they don’t need to win the game, they just need to lose by less than 6 points. This is called covering the spread, and it is applied to both favorites (- next to point spread, called “giving points”) and underdogs (+ sign next to point spread, called “getting points”). If your NBA point spread bet wins, your team covered the spread.\\n\\nYou’re probably noticing that most point spreads have the same odds on either side, unlike moneylines. This is because rather than use the odds to make bets even on each side, they use the point spread to even things out by having the better team have to cover a larger margin of victory. Bettors beware though, there is still juice, or vig baked into these odds as well. This is the tax that sportsbooks collect on each bet. Typically you’ll see odds of -110/-110 on either side of the point spread, implying that based on that point spread it’s a 50/50 chance on either side, minus the vig.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"What is an NBA Over/Under or Total?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"Betting an Over/Under or Total in the NBA is one of the more popular types of bets you can make. A Total, or Over/Under is a bet on the combined total score of the game (hence being called Totals) of both teams. If the Total for the Warriors vs Lakers example above is set at 225, you are betting that at the end of the game the sum total of the Warriors points and the Lakers points would be over or under (hence being called Over/Under) the number of 225. If the final score is Warriors 120, Lakers 101 the game is said to have gone Under (total of 221 less than 225). If the final is Warriors 120, Lakers 110 the game is said to have gone Over (total of 230 &gt; 225).\\n\\nIf the final score is Warriors 118, Lakers 107 the game is said to have Pushed (total of 225 = 225). Pushes can happen in both Point Spreads and Totals. If this occurs, bettors on both sides get their money back. You’ll often see Over/Unders and Point Spreads set at non-whole numbers, say 225.5. That extra 0.5 is called the hook. Spreads or Totals that have the hook prevent a push from happening but bring in the possibility of winning (or losing) by that extra half a point.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"NBA Betting Strategies\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"Now that we’ve outlined the most popular types of NBA bets, let’s go through some profitable NBA betting strategies to help you win more money betting on the NBA!\\n\\n• Check NBA Injury Reports - NBA injuries can happen frequently and often aren’t announced until shortly before tip-off. By closely monitoring the injury reports you can get in before the lines start moving in one direction or the other based on the news.\\n\\n• Scheduling Advantages - The NBA is a long grind of a season, 82 games in all. There are many advantages to understanding a team’s spot within the schedule and how to use that to influence your betting decisions. Each NBA team will play at least 13 or 14 back-to-back games each season, meaning they play games on two days directly in a row with no rest. As a bettor, you can use that to your advantage in deciding who to bet on or if the game will go over or under. Another advantageous scheduling spot for bettors is teams that are coming off of long road trips. Fading a team in their first home game after 4 away games have been a profitable betting system for the past 3 seasons.\\n\\n• Live Betting NBA Games - Live betting is a great way to make the game you’re watching more interesting, but it also offers bettors a way to hedge out of (or double down on) bets made before the game. There are a couple of important things to note when live betting NBA games, though. You should always try and live bet NBA games during stoppages in play or commercial breaks, as the lines during live-action are often way more volatile. Additionally, bettors can also take advantage of in-game momentum swings - especially early in the game. A team may come out hot and go up by 10 or 15 points in the first 5 minutes of the game, which will drastically impact live odds, despite there being 43 minutes left of game time.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"Where to bet on NBA?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"Most importantly, in order to bet on the NBA you need to be signed up for sportsbooks to be able to actually place some bets!

It is simply betting on a team to win the game outright. Your team could win by 1 point or 50 points, it could require overtime or be done in regulation - all that you are betting on is the direct outcome of the game. The team with a - sign next to its odds is said to be the favorite and the team with the + sign next to its odds is the underdog. Speaking of odds, while the concept is simple the strategy of betting moneylines gets a little more complex. The odds directly determine how much you need to stake to win a certain amount of money. If the Golden State Warriors are -275 favorites over the Los Angeles Lakers, you would have to bet $275 to win only $100. Conversely, the Lakers are +200 underdogs a $100 bet would net you a $200 profit if they were to win.\"},{\"question\":\"What is an NBA Point Spread?\",\"answer\":\"When you bet on an NBA point spread, you’re betting on the margin of victory (or defeat) as opposed to the outright winner of the game. Let’s say you bet the Golden State Warriors -6.5 vs the Los Angeles Lakers. This would mean that to win your bet the Warriors would need to win by at least 7 points. Conversely, if you bet the Lakers +6.5 they don’t need to win the game, they just need to lose by less than 6 points. This is called covering the spread, and it is applied to both favorites (- next to point spread, called “giving points”) and underdogs (+ sign next to point spread, called “getting points”). If your NBA point spread bet wins, your team covered the spread.\\n\\nYou’re probably noticing that most point spreads have the same odds on either side, unlike moneylines. This is because rather than use the odds to make bets even on each side, they use the point spread to even things out by having the better team have to cover a larger margin of victory. Bettors beware though, there is still juice, or vig baked into these odds as well. This is the tax that sportsbooks collect on each bet. Typically you’ll see odds of -110/-110 on either side of the point spread, implying that based on that point spread it’s a 50/50 chance on either side, minus the vig.\"},{\"question\":\"What is an NBA Over/Under or Total?\",\"answer\":\"Betting an Over/Under or Total in the NBA is one of the more popular types of bets you can make. A Total, or Over/Under is a bet on the combined total score of the game (hence being called Totals) of both teams. If the Total for the Warriors vs Lakers example above is set at 225, you are betting that at the end of the game the sum total of the Warriors points and the Lakers points would be over or under (hence being called Over/Under) the number of 225. If the final score is Warriors 120, Lakers 101 the game is said to have gone Under (total of 221 less than 225). If the final is Warriors 120, Lakers 110 the game is said to have gone Over (total of 230 \\u003e 225).\\n\\nIf the final score is Warriors 118, Lakers 107 the game is said to have Pushed (total of 225 = 225). Pushes can happen in both Point Spreads and Totals. If this occurs, bettors on both sides get their money back. You’ll often see Over/Unders and Point Spreads set at non-whole numbers, say 225.5.

By closely monitoring the injury reports you can get in before the lines start moving in one direction or the other based on the news.\\n\\n• Scheduling Advantages - The NBA is a long grind of a season, 82 games in all. There are many advantages to understanding a team’s spot within the schedule and how to use that to influence your betting decisions. Each NBA team will play at least 13 or 14 back-to-back games each season, meaning they play games on two days directly in a row with no rest. As a bettor, you can use that to your advantage in deciding who to bet on or if the game will go over or under. Another advantageous scheduling spot for bettors is teams that are coming off of long road trips. Fading a team in their first home game after 4 away games have been a profitable betting system for the past 3 seasons.\\n\\n• Live Betting NBA Games - Live betting is a great way to make the game you’re watching more interesting, but it also offers bettors a way to hedge out of (or double down on) bets made before the game. There are a couple of important things to note when live betting NBA games, though. You should always try and live bet NBA games during stoppages in play or commercial breaks, as the lines during live-action are often way more volatile. Additionally, bettors can also take advantage of in-game momentum swings - especially early in the game. A team may come out hot and go up by 10 or 15 points in the first 5 minutes of the game, which will drastically impact live odds, despite there being 43 minutes left of game time.\"},{\"question\":\"Where to bet on NBA?\",\"answer\":\"Most importantly, in order to bet on the NBA you need to be signed up for sportsbooks to be able to actually place some bets!

It is simply betting on a team to win the game outright. Your team could win by 1 point or 15 points, it could require overtime or be done in regulation - all that you are betting on is the direct outcome of the game. The team with a - sign next to its odds is said to be the favorite and the team with the + sign next to its odds is the underdog. Speaking of odds, while the concept is simple the strategy of betting moneylines gets a little more complex. The odds directly determine how much you need to stake to win a certain amount of money. If the LA Kings are -275 favorites over the Chicago Blackhawks, you would have to bet $275 to win only $100. Conversely, the Blackhawks are +200 underdogs a $100 bet would net you a $200 profit if they were to win.\"},{\"question\":\"What is an NHL Puck Line (Point Spread)?\",\"answer\":\"When you bet on an NHL point spread, you’re betting on the margin of victory (or defeat) as opposed to the outright winner of the game. This is called the puck line and is typically set at +/-1.5 Let’s say you bet the LA Kings -1.5 vs the Chicago Blackhawks. This would mean that to win your bet the Kings would need to win by at least 2 points. Conversely, if you bet the Blackhawks +1.5 they don’t actually need to win the game, they just need to lose by less than 2 points. This is called covering the spread, and it is applied to both favorites (- next to point spread, called “giving points”) and underdogs (+ sign next to point spread, called “getting points”). If your NHL point spread bet wins, your team covered the spread.\\n\\nYou’re probably noticing that most point spreads have the same odds on either side, unlike moneylines. This is because rather than use the odds to make bets even on each side, they use the point spread to even things out by having the better team have to cover a larger margin of victory. Bettors beware though, there is still juice, or vig baked into these odds as well. This is the tax that sportsbooks collect on each bet. Typically you’ll see odds of -110/-110 on either side of the point spread, implying that based on that point spread it’s a 50/50 chance on either side, minus the vig.\"},{\"question\":\"What is an NHL Over/Under or Total?\",\"answer\":\"Betting an Over/Under or Total in the NHL is one of the more popular types of bets you can make. A Total, or Over/Under is a bet on the combined total score of the game (hence being called Totals) of both teams. If the Total for the Kings vs Blackhawks example above is set at 4, you are betting that at the end of the game the total of the Kings points and the Blackhawks points would be over or under (hence being called Over/Under) the number of 4. If the final score is Kings 2, Blackhawks 1, the game is said to have gone Under (total of 3 less than 4). If the final is Kings 3, Blackhawks 2 the game is said to have gone Over (total of 5 \\u003e 4).\\n\\nIf the final score is Kings 3, BlackHawks 1 the game is said to have Pushed (total of 4 = 4). Pushes can happen in both Point Spreads and Totals. If this occurs, bettors on both sides get their money back. You’ll often see Over/Unders and Point Spreads set at non-whole numbers, say 5.5.

Spreads or Totals that have the hook prevent a push from happening but bring in the possibility of winning (or losing) by that extra half a point.\"},{\"question\":\"What is an NHL Parlay?\",\"answer\":\"Betting an NHL parlay is another incredibly popular bet. This involves putting multiple choices into one bet slip to get larger odds on the ticket. The catch with this type of bet is that every single choice, or leg, in the parlay has to hit. If even one of those legs does not hit, the entire bet is void.\\n\\nFor example, if you bet on the LA Kings to win, the St. Louis Blues to win, and the Kings vs Blackhawks under 4, all of those things need to happen. The Kings need to win, the Blues need to win, and the Kings vs Blackhawks game needs to go under 3.\"},{\"question\":\"NHL Betting Strategies\",\"answer\":\"Now that we’ve outlined the most popular types of NHL bets, let’s go through some profitable NHL betting strategies to help you win more money betting on the NHL!\\n\\n• Check NHL Injury Reports - NHL injuries can happen frequently and often aren’t announced until shortly before tip-off.

Tennis also has game and set spreads. Let’s say you bet Nadal -1.5 vs Federer. This would mean that to win your bet Nadal would have to win the match in 2 more games than Federer to win a game spread. In a set spread, this would mean Nadal needs to win in straight sets for you to win the bet.

There are three ways to win a fight in MMA: KO, submission, and points. KO, or knock out, is when a fighter is knocked unconscious by their opponent. In the same category as KO is TKO or Technical Knock Out. This is when a fighter is so disoriented they can no longer defend themselves. Submission is when a fighter signals to the referee that they submit to their opponent. Finally, points are when the fight goes the most rounds it could and has to be decided by the judges scoring decisions.

Similar to the NHL, MLB Run Lines are often a set number, regardless of the game at -1.5/+1.5 Let’s say you bet the StL Cardinals -1.5 vs the Chicago Cubs. This would mean that to win your bet the Cardinals would need to win by at least 2 runs. Conversely, if you bet the Cubs +1.5 they don’t actually need to win the game, they just need to lose by less than 2 runs.

A Total, or Over/Under is a bet on the combined total score of the game (hence being called Totals) of both teams. If the Total for the Cardinals vs Cubs example above is set at 4, you are betting that at the end of the game the total of the Cardinals runs and the Cubs runs would be over or under (hence being called Over/Under) the number of 4.

By closely monitoring the injury reports you can get in before the lines start moving in one direction or the other based on the news.\\n\\n• Scheduling Advantages - The MLB is a long grind of a season, 162 games in all. There are many advantages to understanding a team’s spot within the schedule and how to use that to influence your betting decisions. It is not uncommon for an MLB team to be playing multiple series away from home in a row. As a bettor, you can use that to your advantage in deciding who to bet on. Another advantageous scheduling spot for bettors are teams that are coming off of long road trips.\\n\\n• Live Betting MLB Games - Live betting is a great way to make the game you’re watching more interesting, but it also offers bettors a way to hedge out of (or double down on) bets made before the game. There are a couple of important things to note when live betting MLB games, though. You should always try and live bet MLB games during stoppages in play or commercial breaks, as the lines during live-action are often way more volatile. Additionally, bettors can also take advantage of in-game momentum swings - especially early in the game. A team may come out hot and score 4 runs in the first inning of the game, which will drastically impact live odds, despite there being lots of games left.\"},{\"question\":\"Where to bet on MLB?\",\"answer\":\"Most importantly, in order to bet on the MLB you need to be signed up for sportsbooks to be able to actually place some bets!

If the Total for the Rams vs Bears example above is set at 41, you are betting that at the end of the game the total of the Rams points and the Bears points would be over or under (hence being called Over/Under) the number of 41. If the final score is Rams 21, Bears 14, the game is said to have gone Under (total of 35 less than 41). If the final is Rams 28, Bears 21 the game is said to have gone Over (total of 49 \\u003e 41).\\n\\nIf the final score is Rams 28, Bears 13 the game is said to have Pushed (total of 41 = 41).

By closely monitoring the injury reports you can get in before the lines start moving in one direction or the other based on the news.\\n\\n• Scheduling Advantages - The NFL is a long grind of a season, 17 brutal games in all. There are many advantages to understanding a team’s spot within the schedule and how to use that to influence your betting decisions. The schedule is a mix of divisional games (home and away) and games against a specified division that each is matched with, season by season. This means that not every NFL team plays against each other every season. As a bettor, you can use things like strength of schedule, or upcoming games to your advantage in deciding who to bet on.\\n\\n• Live Betting NFL Games - Live betting is a great way to make the game you’re watching more interesting, but it also offers bettors a way to hedge out of (or double down on) bets made before the game. There are a couple of important things to note when live betting NFL games, though. You should always try and live bet NFL games during stoppages in play or commercial breaks, as the lines during live-action are often way more volatile. Additionally, bettors can also take advantage of in-game momentum swings - especially early in the game. A team may come out hot and go up by two touchdowns early in the first quarter of the game, which will drastically impact live odds, despite there being lots of game left.\"},{\"question\":\"Where to bet on the NFL?\",\"answer\":\"Most importantly, to bet on the NFL you need to be signed up for sportsbooks to be able to actually place some bets!

It is simply betting on a team to win the game outright. Your team could win by 1 point or 50 points, it could require overtime or be done in regulation - all that you are betting on is the direct outcome of the game. The team with a - sign next to its odds is said to be the favorite and the team with the + sign next to its odds is the underdog. Speaking of odds, while the concept is simple the strategy of betting moneylines gets a little more complex. The odds directly determine how much you need to stake to win a certain amount of money. If Alabama is a -275 favorite over Clemson, you would have to bet $275 to win only $100. Conversely, Clemson is a +200 underdog and a $100 bet would net you a $200 profit if they were to win.\"},{\"question\":\"What is a College Football Point Spread?\",\"answer\":\"When you bet on an NCAAF point spread, you’re betting on the margin of victory (or defeat) as opposed to the outright winner of the game.

Conversely, if you bet Clemson +1.5 they don’t actually need to win the game, they just need to lose by less than 2 points.

With the rise of fantasy sports player, prop bets have risen in popularity extensively.

You can bet on any combination of player stats but the most popular are points, rebounds, assists, blocks, and steals. You can even bet on combinations of those stats such as points + assists, or steals + blocks. Some states and sportsbooks don’t allow college player props so be sure to check your state and the sportsbook you’re betting at to see if these markets are available to you.\\n\\nTeam and Game props are also a great way to bet on a game if you’re not wanting to back a specific side or the total.

A moneyline bet is simply a bet on the winner of a game or match. Let’s say there’s a matchup between the Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles. The moneyline odds for the Cowboys are -250 and the moneyline odds for the Eagles +210. This means you would need to bet $250 on the Cowboys to win $100, while a $100 bet on the Eagles would net you $210 profit if they were to win.\"},{\"question\":\"How to Read NFL Point Spreads\",\"answer\":\"NFL point spreads can be difficult to understand as they are not as straightforward as the moneyline. However, they are a bit more simple to understand when it comes to the odds. Rather than use the odds themselves to try and even out the incentive to bet on either team, they define a margin of victory (or defeat) with much more palatable (and less juiced) odds. In the same Cowboys vs Eagles example, the Cowboys would be 3.5 point favorites (or -3.5) - meaning they have to win the game by 4 or more for the bet to win. The Eagles would be 3.5 point underdogs (or +3.5) - meaning they need to lose by 3 or less or win outright for the bet to win. Typically point spread odds will most frequently be -110 on either side ($110 bet to win $100), however, they can “juice” the odds one way or the other to incentivize bettors to bet one side or the other instead of just \\u003c0\\u003emoving the actual point spread line\\u003c/0\\u003e.\",\"links\":[\"https://oddsjam.com/betting-education/betting-line-movement\"]},{\"question\":\"How to Read NFL Over/Unders or Totals\",\"answer\":\"Who doesn’t love points in an NFL game? The Total or Over/Under is a bet on the combined total score of an NFL game. The Over/Under in the Cowboys vs Eagles example above is 45.5 points. This means that if the Cowboys win 51-26 (77 points), the Over will win. If they win 24-20 (24 points) the Under will win. Typically Total odds will most frequently be -110 on either side ($110 bet to win $100), however, they can “juice” the odds one way or the other to incentivize bettors to bet one side or the other instead of just moving the actual Over/Under line.\"},{\"question\":\"What are NFL Prop Bets?\",\"answer\":\"The NFL is a star-driven league and Player Prop bets are an easy way to have action on your favorite player to watch instead of hitching your wagon to the entire team. With the rise of fantasy sports player prop bets have risen in popularity extensively. Player props are similar to total bets in that you are betting whether or not a certain player’s statistic of choice is over or under a certain number. You can bet on all combinations of player stats but the most popular are Rush Yards, Receiving Yards, TD Receptions, and TD Throws.\\n\\nTeam and Game props are also a great way to bet on a game if you’re not wanting to back a specific side or the total. Again, these are similar to totals or over/unders but they are for team or game level statistics such as team totals (how many points a team will score), half/full game-winner combos, if the game will go into overtime, and many more.\"},{\"question\":\"What are NFL Futures Bets?\",\"answer\":\"Futures bets, unlike all the other types of bets outlined here, are not based on the outcome of a single game, but on an entire season. These are bets that often have long odds, but are a fun way to keep a rooting interest throughout an entire season, as well as buy low on certain teams or players. Examples of NFL futures bets would be betting on a team to win the Super Bowl, or their division or conference. You can also bet on season-ending awards, player to win MVP, player to win Rookie of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year, and more!\"}],\"ncaaf\":[{\"question\":\"How to Use OddsJam’s College Football Odds Comparison Tool\",\"answer\":\"The importance of getting the best odds on your NCAAF bets cannot be overstated. \\u003c0\\u003eLine shopping\\u003c/0\\u003e is a strategy used by bettors to find the sportsbook that is offering them the best odds on the bet they want to make.

Let’s say you want to bet on the Ohio State Buckeyes to beat the Oregon Ducks. One sportsbook has their moneyline odds at -675, another has them at -650. One bet requires you to bet $675 to win $100, while the other only requires you to bet $650 to win $100. To be a profitable sports bettor over time you must be getting the best odds available to you. Let’s say you want to bet the Buckeyes point spread against the Ducks. One sportsbook has them at -14, and another has them at -15.
